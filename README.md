An example of using a curved surface for a Box2DWeb java script implementation
==========
By clicking on the canvas, the user generates a control point - and a rolling 2 dimensional
initiates a roll down the curve that has been created.

This used the Box2DWeb Javascript library, and the written portion of the code 
is written in the curve.js file.

The implementation can be seen here :
